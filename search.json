    "title": "From Stats to Success: Matt Rhule’s Impact on Nebraska Football",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In September 2022, Nebraska football parted ways with head coach Scott Frost, who had been brought in with hopes of “saving” the program. Just two months later, in November, the Huskers hired Matt Rhule—a coach known for revitalizing struggling teams like Temple and Baylor. Rhule embraced Nebraska’s blue-collar roots, its passionate fanbase, and the deep-seated desire to return to greatness. “We’re not just going to restore Nebraska football,” he said in his introductory press conference, “we’re going to evolve it.\nDuring the remainder of the 2022 season, interim head coach Mickey Joseph stepped in, helping improve play on both sides of the ball. Despite the improvements, Nebraska finished the season with a 3-6 record after Frost’s departure. It would take a few more seasons for the program to truly find its footing again.\nAlthough the defense gained more yards in 2022, the offense was outperformed in both the 2023 and 2024 seasons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nseason_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Season = c(\"2022\", \"2023\", \"2024\"),\n  OffenseYards = c(344, 312, 359),\n  DefenseYards = c(414, 303, 317)\n)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Convert to long format\nlong_data &lt;- pivot_longer(season_data,\n                          cols = c(OffenseYards, DefenseYards),\n                          names_to = \"Type\",\n                          values_to = \"Yards\")\nggplot(long_data, aes(x = Season, y = Yards, fill = Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Offense vs Defense Yards by Season\",\n       x = \"Season\",\n       y = \"Total Yards\",\n       subtitle=\"Offensive and Defense Yards Before and After Matt Rhule.\", \n       caption=\"Source: SportsRefrence | By Grayce Lalim\",\n       fill = \"Category\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"OffenseYards\" = \"red\", \"DefenseYards\" = \"black\")) + coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Matt Rhule’s first year at Nebraska wasn’t flashy, it laid a strong foundation for the program’s future. He began establishing a new standard for recruiting and defining what the team stands for—both on and off the field. By the end of the 2023 season, Nebraska fans could sense a shift. While the stats didn’t necessarily surpass previous years, there was a noticeable reduction in mistakes and a clearer identity taking shape.\nRhule’s impact was especially evident on the defensive side of the ball.\nHe embraced Nebraska’s deep-rooted Blackshirt tradition and, by his second season in 2024, the defense was playing with renewed intensity. Opponent rushing yards were cut by 40%, and the Huskers climbed into the top 15 nationally in turnovers forced. Sack totals nearly doubled, and Nebraska began winning close games that previously slipped away.\nOne of the most telling signs of improvement was the increase in interceptions by the defense, as shown here:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\ndefense &lt;- read_csv(\"data/defense.csv\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=defense, aes(x=Season, y=Int), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=defense, aes(x=Season, y=Int), color=\"red\")|&gt;\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Interceptions\", \n    title=\"Defensive Takeaways: Nebraska's Interception Numbers\", \n    subtitle=\"Interceptions recorded in 2022, 2023, and 2024 seasons.\", \n    caption=\"Source: SportsRefrence | By Grayce Lalim\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn offense, Nebraska became both efficient and unpredictable. Rhule’s staff embraced a dual-threat quarterback system, which added a dynamic edge to the Huskers’ play-calling. The team’s scoring average jumped from just 22.6 points per game to over 30. Total rushing and receiving yards surged to 4,667 in the 2024 season, up from 4,130 in 2022.\nThe 2024 season also kicked off with major excitement, as Nebraska landed the No. 1 quarterback in the nation—5-star recruit Dylan Raiola.\nThe improvements weren’t just in the big plays. Passing completion percentage rose by nearly 7%, third-down conversions improved by 10%, and red zone efficiency ranked among the best in the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\noffense &lt;- read_csv(\"data/offense.csv\")\n\ntotaloffense &lt;- offense |&gt; \n  select(Season, Rec, Rush, TD, Pts) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(Season), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    ReceivingYds = sum(Rec),\n    RushingYds = sum(Rush),\n    TouchDowns = sum(TD),\n    Points = sum(Pts)\n  )\ntotaloffense |&gt; \n  gt()|&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    ReceivingYds = \"Receiving Yards\",\n    RushingYds = \"Rushing Yards\",\n    TouchDowns = \"Touchdowns\",\n    Points = \"Total Points\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How Nebraska Offense Changed\",\n    subtitle = \"Matt Rhule's Advancements of the Offense in Just Two Years.\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Grayce Lalim  |  **Source:** SportsRefrence: 2022, 2023, 2024 Nebraska Cornhuskers Football Stats\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2024\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Nebraska Offense Changed\n\n\nMatt Rhule's Advancements of the Offense in Just Two Years.\n\n\nSeason\nReceiving Yards\nRushing Yards\nTouchdowns\nTotal Points\n\n\n\n\n2022\n17\n17\n35\n271\n\n\n2023\n10\n16\n27\n216\n\n\n2024\n13\n22\n38\n306\n\n\n\nBy: Grayce Lalim | Source: SportsRefrence: 2022, 2023, 2024 Nebraska Cornhuskers Football Stats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the 2024 season, Nebraska had finally turned a corner—finishing with a winning record and securing its first bowl game victory since 2015.

    "title": "From Backup to Breakout. Sam Darnold Emerges as an MVP Contender with the Vikings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Sam Darnold’s career has been anything but predictable. From his promising start at USC to the turbulence of his NFL journey with the Jets and Panthers, Darnold had faced countless obstacles. Yet, through it all, the Minnesota Vikings saw something in him that others didn’t—a chance for redemption and a fresh start. In their dynamic offensive system, Darnold not only rediscovered his potential but also became a key contributor to the Vikings’ success. This is how an underdog quarterback transformed into a vital piece of one of the NFL’s most exciting offenses.\nSam Darnold started at the University of Southern California, where he was a standout quarterback. With a 20–4 record as a starter, Darnold demonstrated his potential as a leader and playmaker. After a successful college career, he was selected third overall by the New York Jets, marking the beginning of his professional career.\nDarnold arrived in New York with high expectations. In his rookie season in 2018, he made history as the youngest Week 1 starting quarterback at just 21 years old. His debut was promising with 7 touchdowns and over 2,800 passing yards. But things quickly soured. The Jets hired Adam Gase as head coach in 2019, a move many saw as a poor fit for the young QB. That year, Darnold battled injuries and sickness, while the team struggled under a lack of offensive support. Over the next three seasons, Darnold’s growth stalled. The Jets went 13–25 during his tenure, and his inconsistency was evident, with 45 touchdowns and 39 interceptions. After the Jets selected Zach Wilson in the 2021 draft and brought in new head coach Robert Saleh, Darnold’s time in New York ended. The Jets traded him to the Carolina Panthers to give him a fresh start.\nSam Darnold’s 2021 season with the Panthers started strong. He led the team to a 3–0 record, showing glimpses of his old form. However, the season quickly unraveled due to offensive line issues, injuries, and turnovers. By 2022, he had lost the starting role to Baker Mayfield, but Darnold battled back, starting the final six games of the season. He finished with a 4–2 record, throwing 7 touchdowns to just 3 interceptions—a solid performance, but it wasn’t enough to secure his future in Carolina. Darnold signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers in 2023, where he would serve as a backup to Brock Purdy in the QB-friendly system built by coach Kyle Shanahan. While Darnold didn’t see significant action on the field, the 49ers’ system allowed him to refine his decision-making, footwork, and mechanics, all critical aspects that had plagued him in previous years. Although his on-field stats were modest, the time spent in San Francisco proved to be a crucial turning point for Darnold.\nAfter his time with the 49ers, Darnold was given a fresh start with the Minnesota Vikings. With a new system and a supportive cast around him, he finally realized the potential that once made him a top NFL prospect. His time under the Vikings’ coaching staff allowed him to shine, helping elevate both his own game and the Vikings’ offense.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary (tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\ndarnold &lt;- read_csv(\"data/samdarnold.csv\")\n\ntotaldarnold &lt;- darnold |&gt; \n  select(Season, Team, TD, `Cmp%`,QBR) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(Season), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Team = first(Team),\n    Touchdown = sum(TD),\n    CompletionPercentage = sum(`Cmp%`),\n    QBR = sum(QBR)\n  )\ntotaldarnold |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Season = \"Season\",\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    Touchdown = \"Touchdowns\",\n    CompletionPercentage = \"Completion Percentage\",\n    QBR = \"Quarterbacks Rating\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How Sam Darnold’s Performance Has Shifted Across Seasons\",\n    subtitle = \"Analyzing Sam Darnold’s NFL journey through different teams, a look at how his performance has evolved with each team.\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Grayce Lalim  |  **Source:** SportsRefrence.com\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#4F2683\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FFC62F\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2024\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Sam Darnold’s Performance Has Shifted Across Seasons\n\n\nAnalyzing Sam Darnold’s NFL journey through different teams, a look at how his performance has evolved with each team.\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nTouchdowns\nCompletion Percentage\nQuarterbacks Rating\n\n\n\n\n2018\nNYJ\n17\n57.7\n45.9\n\n\n2019\nNYJ\n19\n61.9\n45.6\n\n\n2020\nNYJ\n9\n59.6\n32.9\n\n\n2021\nCAR\n9\n59.9\n38.8\n\n\n2022\nCAR\n7\n58.6\n51.4\n\n\n2023\nSFO\n2\n60.9\n49.3\n\n\n2024\nMIN\n35\n66.2\n60.4\n\n\n\nBy: Grayce Lalim | Source: SportsRefrence.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Darnold and the Minnesota Vikings offense became the perfect, unexpected storm. When Darnold arrived in Minnesota, expectations weren’t high. But the Vikings—and head coach Kevin O’Connell—provided Darnold with stability and a smart system filled with elite weapons, and he began to thrive. The Vikings’ offense gave Darnold elite receivers like Justin Jefferson, along with several emerging young talents. For the first time in his professional career, Darnold also had a strong offensive line protecting him. The Minnesota coaching staff built the offense around his strengths, resulting in a revitalized quarterback who played with confidence and efficiency. In the 2024 season, Darnold threw for over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, ranking 5th in the NFL. He posted a 102.5 passer rating and a 66.2% completion percentage. Darnold was instrumental in leading the Vikings to a 14–3 regular season record.\nSam Darnold’s impact extended beyond statistics—he helped elevate the Vikings’ offense past NFC powerhouses like the Super Bowl Champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. While the Eagles struggled with inconsistency late in the season, the Vikings surged behind Darnold’s leadership. His poise in the pocket, paired with a well-balanced scheme, allowed Minnesota to control the tempo, finish drives, and dominate through the air. Philadelphia, led by Jalen Hurts and his dual-threat ability, often sputtered late in games and lacked the passing efficiency that Minnesota consistently delivered. The Vikings, on the other hand, were surgical and explosive. Darnold proved he could not only manage games but win them. This wasn’t just a feel-good story—it was a strategic masterclass. Minnesota built its offense around Darnold’s strengths, and it paid off. Justin Jefferson flourished, the offensive line held strong, and Darnold delivered week after week. One of the only teams to outperform the Vikings during the regular season was the Detroit Lions, who were later eliminated in the divisional round by the Washington Commanders.\nIn 2024, the Vikings didn’t just keep up with NFC elites like the Eagles—they outperformed them.\n\n\nCode\nvikings &lt;- read_csv(\"data/vikings2024.csv\")\neagles &lt;- read_csv(\"data/eagles2024.csv\")\nnfc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nfcteams.csv\")\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nfc, aes(x=Week, y=PassingYds, group=Team), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data = eagles, aes(x = Week, y = PassingYds), color = \"#004C54\",size = 1.5) +\n  geom_line(data = vikings, aes(x = Week, y = PassingYds), color = \"#4F2683\",size=1.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\", \n    y = \"Passing Yards\", \n    title = \"Vikings Outshine Eagles and Emerge as a Rising Force in the NFC\", \n    subtitle = \"Minnesota Vikings' Offensive Surge vs. Super Bowl Champions the Philadelphia Eagles\", \n    caption = \"Source: SportsReference.com | Grayce Lalim\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a season full of surprises, Sam Darnold emerged as a legitimate MVP contender, firmly planting himself among the league’s best. Once dismissed as a journeyman quarterback, Darnold shattered expectations by finishing in the top five in passing yards and touchdowns, joining elite company like Joe Burrow, Jared Goff, Baker Mayfield, and Geno Smith.\nWhile each of those quarterbacks had standout seasons, it was Darnold who consistently delivered big plays in crucial moments, powering the Minnesota Vikings to a 14–3 record and one of the NFL’s most dangerous offenses. Darnold not only led with stats but with poise, leadership, and resilience. He didn’t just bounce back, he rewrote his narrative, and in doing so, put himself firmly in the MVP conversation.\n\n\nCode\nquaterbacks &lt;- read_csv(\"data/quaterbacks2024.csv\")\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nsamdarnold &lt;- quaterbacks |&gt; filter(Player == \"Sam Darnold\")\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nburrow &lt;- quaterbacks |&gt; filter(Player == \"Joe Burrow\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=quaterbacks, aes(x=TD, y=Yds...12), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=samdarnold, aes(x=TD, y=Yds...12), color=\"#4F2683\") +\n  geom_point(data=burrow, aes(x=TD, y=Yds...12), color=\"#FB4F14\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=samdarnold, aes(x=TD, y=Yds...12, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=burrow, aes(x=TD, y=Yds...12, label=Player)) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n           xmin = 30, xmax = 50, \n           ymin = 3000, ymax = 5500) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=25, y=5000, label=\"Top 5 Quarterbacks\"), size=4) +\n labs(title=\"The 2024 NFL Passing Leaders Dominating the Game\",\n      subtitle=\"A Closer Look at Sam Darnold's Standout Season Among Elite Quarterbacks\",\n      x=\"Touchdowns\", \n      y=\"Yards Gained By Passing\",\n      caption=\"Source: SportsRefrence.com | Grayce Lalim\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Darnold’s story is no longer about unmet expectations, it’s about redemption, resilience, and reinvention. After years of being doubted, traded, and overlooked, Darnold found the perfect fit in Minnesota. Surrounded by a forward-thinking coaching staff, elite talent, and a system built for his success, he transformed from a struggling backup into a poised, high-impact starter. His journey, marked by setbacks, growth, and ultimate revival, culminated in a breakout 2024 season where he didn’t just contribute; he competed with the league’s best.\nDarnold’s rise with the Vikings wasn’t a fluke—it was the result of belief, preparation, and opportunity. He reminded the league that sometimes, all a player needs is the right environment to unlock their potential. And in doing so, he helped turn Minnesota into an offensive powerhouse and positioned himself as one of the NFL’s most compelling comeback stories. If 2024 proved anything, it’s this: Sam Darnold isn’t done, he’s just getting started."
